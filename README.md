# 📝 Canopy Waitlist Form – Explanation

This document explains the **Canopy Waitlist Form** and what information is required when submitting an idea for an **application-specific Layer 1 blockchain**.

Canopy is designed for builders who want **full control over their blockchain infrastructure**, without sharing resources with unrelated applications.

---

## 🌱 What is Canopy?

**Canopy** is a blockchain infrastructure focused on **application-specific blockchains**.

Instead of deploying on a shared network, builders can launch:
- A **dedicated Layer 1**
- With custom rules
- Independent performance
- Full control over validation and resources

This is ideal for projects that need scalability, sovereignty, and customization.

---

## 📋 Purpose of the Waitlist Form

The **Waitlist Form** is used to:
- Collect early ideas from builders
- Understand potential use cases
- Prepare future application-specific chains on Canopy

You are not deploying a chain yet — you are **submitting a concept**.

---

## 🧩 Information Required

### 1️⃣ L1 Name
**What it is:**  
The name of your Layer 1 blockchain.

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum: **25 characters**
- Short, clear, and unique
- Should reflect the project’s purpose

**Examples:**
- `GameVerse`
- `DeFiRail`
- `SocialNet`
- `DataChain`

---

### 2️⃣ L1 Symbol
**What it is:**  
The token ticker for your Layer 1 network.

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum: **10 characters**
- Usually uppercase
- Represents the native token of the chain

**Examples:**
- `GVR`
- `DFR`
- `SOC`
- `DATA`

📌 This symbol will represent gas fees, staking, or governance on your chain.

---

### 3️⃣ L1 Chain Description
**What it is:**  
A brief explanation of **what your application-specific chain is built for**.

**What to include:**
- Type of application (DeFi, gaming, social, infra, etc.)
- Why it needs a dedicated chain
- What problem it solves
- Who the users are

**Good description example:**
> GameVerse is an application-specific Layer 1 designed for on-chain gaming.  
> It focuses on low-latency transactions, NFT-based game assets, and custom gas mechanics to support high-frequency in-game actions without congestion.

**Simple description example:**
> DeFiRail is a dedicated Layer 1 for decentralized lending and trading protocols, optimized for fast settlement and predictable gas fees.

---

## 🎯 Why Application-Specific Chains?

Using a dedicated chain allows builders to:
- Avoid congestion from unrelated apps
- Customize performance and fees
- Optimize security for a specific use case
- Scale independently

Canopy enables this without the complexity of building a Layer 1 from scratch.

---

## 🚀 Summary

The Canopy Waitlist Form asks for:
- **L1 Name** → Your blockchain’s identity  
- **L1 Symbol** → Your native token ticker  
- **L1 Description** → Your use case and vision  

It is a **concept submission**, not a final deployment.
